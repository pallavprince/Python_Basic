###Running instructions in Interactive interpreter and a Python Script

# Python is an Object oriented programing language

# to comment in code we use hash "#" in starting of line, so our computer not read commented line at time of execution

# For comment the line we use #
# But when we want to comment multiple line then:
# line 1
# line 2
# line 3

# or using ''' line1 line2 line3 '''


''' to comment multiple line then we can use three inverted (single/ double) at start and end of lines
here we can see the multiple lines are commented'''


'this line also ignore when run the code'

A = 'this line act as string assign in variable A'

x = 'Ram'
y = 'Sita'


''' Variable should be start by _  (underscore) or Character
Variable may contain Alpha-numeric and start only by character or _'''


a = int(1)     # a will be 1
b = int(2.8) # b will be 2
b1 = float(2.8) # b1 will be 2.8

c = int("3") # c will be 3 by converting string 3 in integer 


d = str("s1") # d will be 's1'
e = str(2)    # e will be '2'
f = str(3.0)  # f will be '3.0'


''' we use print() for print output'''

print (a)
print (A)

print ("here x and y value will print together " + str(x + y))

print (a+b)

print ('\n make a new line at output and print variable d value ' + d)
