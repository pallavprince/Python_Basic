# Write a program to purposefully raise Indentation Error and Correct it

'''indent is important in python. If you can not follow standar indentetion then your code shows error at time of execution
you can use ither tab or space to define indent

Example:

here we want to print number from 0 to 9 then we use for loop, but we neet to keep the print command inside the for loop
so, here we use space before starting print line.

for i in range (0,10):
    print (i)

Below code give you error:
for i in range (0,10):
print (i)

you can see code error while running.

'''

for i in range (0,10):
print (i)
